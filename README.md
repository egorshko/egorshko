<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Egor Shkolnikov</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am Game Developer</h3>




## ðŸš€ About Me
I've been learning Unity and C# since 2020, and my over 10 years of design experience have shaped my product vision and understanding of complex projects. I have advanced skills in Unity3D, character rigging, and have worked with Spine. Additionally, I am proficient in C# and have applied the MVC, MVP and MVVM design patterns in my projects. I am well-versed in using ECS, Zenject and UniRx, and I am adept at creating user interfaces. I also have expertise in various design software, including 3Ds Max, Corona, ZBrush, Blender, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Fuse, Substance Painter, and Marvelous Designer.
